                                            workhorses rather than discard them can be a testament to their lasting value
                                            and reliability.

                                            For decision-makers in Saudi Arabia&#39;s industrial sectors, the economic
                                            argument
                                            for choosing to repair and refurbish equipment over purchasing new is
                                            compelling. The cost of acquiring new machinery can be prohibitively high, not
                                            only in terms of the initial investment but also considering the depreciation
                                            and
                                            the longer timeline to achieve a return on investment (ROI). In contrast,
                                            refurbishing equipment can significantly extend its operational life at a
                                            fraction of
                                            the cost, ensuring that businesses can allocate their financial resources more
                                            effectively elsewhere.

                                            transparent, fixed-cost solution to maintenance, allowing businesses to budget
                                            effectively and avoid unexpected financial burdens.
